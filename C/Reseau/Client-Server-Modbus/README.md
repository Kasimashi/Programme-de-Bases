# modbus-pwc-interface - a small libmodbus example

This project contains a small set of examples for using
libmodbus (see github.com/stephane/libmodbus). Its intended
to provide some demos and for a MODBUS interface to a sky camera.

Of course the code itself has been cut with a blunt spoon 
for the libmodbus tests

Current Status: still using the spoon.
